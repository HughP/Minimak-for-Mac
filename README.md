# Minimak Keyboard Layout Bundle

[Minimak](http://www.minimak.org/) keyboard layout bundle for OSX.

## Details

After coming across [Minimak](http://www.minimak.org/) via Jeff [codinghorror] Atwoods tweet about this keyboard layout, I was intrigued.

As there wasn't a layout download for OSX, I put a bundle together using [Ukelele](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=ukelele)

It contains 3 layouts based on the main 3 steps described on the Minimak site

* 4 Key
* 8 Key
* 12 Key

## Installation

Download or clone from Github

Copy the Minimak.bundle file to `/Library/Keyboard Layouts/`

Open System Preferences -> Keyboard -> Input Sources and turn on the layouts.
